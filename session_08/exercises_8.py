# Session 8 Exercises


# All of these questions will use a set of pre-made files with data in. The files are in the text_files directory.
# In order to access the text files from this file, make sure you get into the text_files directory when using read/write.
# Ex: f = open("text_files/austen.txt", "r") OR f = open("text_files/register.txt", "w")


## Section A
# 1. Read the file 'jabberwocky.txt' and print its content to the screen.



# 2. Read the file 'austen.txt' and print the amount of lines in the file.

# f=open ("text_files/austen.txt","r")
# count=0
# for line in f:
#   count+=1

# print(str(count))

# 3. Each line of the file 'numbers.txt' contains a number, write a script to add up all the values in the file.

# x=open("text_files/numbers.txt", "r")
# sum = 0
# for line in x:
#   sum += int(line)
  
# print(sum)


# <---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Section B
# 1. Ask the user to enter their name and append this to a file called 'register.txt'.
# f=open("text_files/register.txt","a")

# name=True
# while name:
#   name = input("what is your name? ")
#   f.write(name + "\n ")

# f.close()

# print("text_files/register.txt")

# 2. Create a new file called 'even.txt' that contains only the even numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'.

# f= open("text_files/numbers.txt","r")
# even=open("text_files/even.txt","w")

# for x in f:
#   if int(x)%2==0:
#     even.write(x)
# even.close()

  
# 3. 'secret.txt' contains a secret message. Each number represents the letter of the alphabet where 1 = A, 2 = B ... Z = 26. 
#    Work out what the secret message says.
# alphabets = {
#     0: "!",
#     1: "A",
#     2: "B",
#     3: "C",
#     4: "D",
#     5: "E",
#     6: "F",
#     7: "G",
#     8: "H",
#     9: "I",
#     10: "J",
#     11: "K",
#     12: "L",
#     13: "M",
#     14: "N",
#     15: "O",
#     16: "P",
#     17: "Q",
#     18: "R",
#     19: "S",
#     20: "T",
#     21: "U",
#     22: "V",
#     23: "W",
#     24: "X",
#     25: "Y",
#     26: "Z"

# }
# word=""

# secret= open("text_files/secret.txt","r")

# for x in secret:
#   word= word + alphabets[int(x)]

# print(word)

# 4. Benfordâ€™s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data are probably going to be small. 
#   For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). 
#   Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. 
#   Work out which of the files contains fake data.
x = open("text_files/accounts_1.txt","r")
y = open("text_files/accounts_2.txt","r")
z = open("text_files/accounts_3.txt","r")
