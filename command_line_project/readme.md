# Password Manager

## Description

This is a simple Python-based password manager that allows you to add, retrieve, delete, and display account information. The account data is stored in a file named `passwords.txt`. 

## Features

- **Add an Account:** You can add a new account with an account name, username, and password.
- **Retrieve an Account:** You can retrieve account information by providing the account name.
- **Delete an Account:** You can delete an account by providing the account name.
- **Display All Passwords:** You can view all stored account information.
- **Master Password:** Access to the password manager is protected by a master password.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the `password_manager.py` script.

3. You mmay be prompted to enter the master password. (The default master password is set as `"Pass123!"` in the code; you should replace it with a secure master password of your own.)

4. Choose from the available options:

   - **1. Add an account:** Enter account details to add a new account.
   - **2. Retrieve an account:** Enter the account name to retrieve account information.
   - **3. Delete an account:** Enter the account name to delete the account.
   - **4. Display all passwords:** View all stored account information.
   - **5. Quit:** Exit the password manager.

## Security Considerations

- The master password should be kept secure. It is essential for accessing the password manager.
- This is a basic implementation for educational purposes. In a production environment, additional security measures (e.g., encryption) should be considered for storing passwords securely.
